# telegraf-ubuntu-docker

Cloned from [https://github.com/influxdata/influxdata-docker/tree/master/telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdata-docker/tree/master/telegraf), modified a bit and included some MIB files for working with SNMP and my Synology DS718+.

A fine working telegraf.conf (excerpt) is attached (fetched from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/bbodsh/huge_telegraf_config_file_for_capturing_snmp/))
